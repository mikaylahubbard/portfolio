            </div>
            <p class="text-secondary" style="line-height: 2;">Power of Patients™, founded by Lynne Becker, is a company dedicated to supporting those with TBIs (Traumatic Brain Injuries) and other brain-related needs. 
                The programs I worked on were Sallie™ and the IISS™. Sallie™ is a healthcare portal designed to track and analyze symptoms, and it can be used by patients, caregivers, therapists, or doctors. 
                The IISS™ is an application that provides real-time triaging, meant to screen injuries to analyze the amount of impact had on the brain. I worked with a small team consisting of the founder, 
                a professional software developer, and two other interns. My primary tasks can be sorted into the following topics: UI/UX Design, Cybersecurity, and Coding.</p>

                The goal of this page is to explain the IISS™ to a sports medecine doctor, or to someone who would be using this web app in the field of sports. This task involved things like learning new software, branding, layout, learning and writing about new information, image editing, and listening to feedback. 
                A large portion of this task, not shown in the recording, is the informational video I created to go in the section titled "The IISS™ as a Triage tool".

                    This is a video is meant to demonstrate the importance of triaging in sports, while promoting the IISS™ as a triage tool. It was inspired by whiteboard animations, and I used 
                    <a href="https://www.canva.com" target="_blank">Canva</a> to create it. I also used AI tools like ChatGBT and DeepAI for image generation and some of the initial script-generation. This project
                    involved learning how to use my design instincts and new knowledge of the IISS™ in a way I had never done before.

                <p class="text-secondary p-3 text-start" style="line-height: 2;">
                    Towards the beginning of the internship, I was tasked with <span class="fw-bold"> updating the company's Data Governance Policies</span>. I was able to do a deep dive into privacy policies, breach policies, and data handling, 
                    ensuring that the company's policies and processes reflected 2025 standards. I did this via researching, analyzing the current policy documents and how the company is structured, creating a checklist of changes to be made,
                    validating the checklist against reliable sources, and then implementing the changes. This task required careful research and analysis to ensure the security of the company's data and all user data, paying special attending to PHI.  
                </p>
                
                <!-- Created and Employee training portal -->

                <p class="text-secondary p-3 text-start" style="line-height: 2;">
                   One of the requirements for a company is that they must attest that all employees are trained on the data policies and on cybersecurity essentials. I was then tasked with
                   <span class="fw-bold">reworking the current process of employee training</span> to better comply with modern expectations and standards. In order to do this I used google's many tools, combining them to create an employee portal 
                   that educates, validates, and keeps a record for all employees. I designed a Google Site which teaches employees about data regulation, company policies, and cybersecurity. I then 
                   created quizes in Google forms to include at the end of each module. The results of these quizzes are then stored in Google Sheets. I then connected all of the data via Google Apps Script, consolodation each
                   employee's quiz scores to a master spreadsheet and an personal spreadsheet for each employee. This way the employer can view all of the employee's progress, and each employee can view their own individual progress. 
                   The end goal is that each employee can complete the training in a clear manner, and the employee can keep a record of training. Additionally, because the content of the training is in a google site, anyone in the 
                   future will be able to edit the course content.

                    This task was a combination of UI/UX analysis and coding. First, I went through each page of the application,
                    documenting the aesthetic suggestions I had. After running through the changes with my mentor, I was able to use these cosmetic edits
                    as a way to first get my hands in the application's code. This involved things like learning the company's coding process, discussing different design options, learning about react and tailwind, 
                    and learning how to implement the designs and functionalities in the current code. <span class="fw-bold">Above is an example of the first change I made: Editing the title and subtitle to make it
