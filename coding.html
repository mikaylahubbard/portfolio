            <p class="text-secondary p-3 text-center" style="line-height: 2;">This web app, titled Time Capsule, was the final project for my Application Development II class.</p>        
        <p class="text-secondary text-start"><span class="fw-bold">Product Goals:</span> Allow users to store their memories. 
            Through the time capsule features made available on this site, one can create snapshots of their current lives, 
            feelings, and personality. Once a time capsule is saved, the user can choose a time it will unlock. Unitl then, 
            the contents of the time capsule will be unavailable. The goal is that when opening a time capsule, 
            the user can get a glimpse into their own past.  This program is meant to foster both current reflection and future recollection. </p>
        <p class="text-secondary text-start"><span class="fw-bold">Technical Aspects:</span> This site was created using the Django framework. The class began
        with a Django refresher and then moved on to project planning and bi-weekly sprints with defined goals. Key aspects of the project were things like user registration
    and login/logout capabilities, different content access for logged in users vs. logged out users, and using Javascript/Json to fetch data and render pages based on user requests.</p>

                <p class="text-secondary p-3 text-start">The name of this app is <span class="fw-bold">Dance Diary</span>. 
                    Its goal is to provide a convenient way for dancers to log their repertoire. 
                    This was built with my sister in mind. It was hard for her to keep all of her dance practice videos organized 
                    and track what pieces and choreographies she had done. With this app, dance students can neatly organize their 
                    repertoire into entries within the app. <br /><br /><span class="fw-bold">Features:</span> Once signed into the app, the user will see the home screen which contains 
                    a list of all their entries, a way to sort between favorites and shared entries, and a hamburger menu which navigates 
                    to all other pages. Each entry contains the name of the dance, the performance date, and the music associated with the dance.
                     There is also a section for notes such as choreography or spacing, and a space for the user to upload videos, 
                     whether of choreography demonstration, practices, or the final performance. This can be used to help the dancer 
                     rehearse with the music, review the choreography, adjust technique, and remember past performances.
                      Another useful feature is the recording feature. The recorder built into the app includes the music for a chosen 
                      entry so the dancer can practice while the music plays. Once recorded, the video will save to the entry, 
                      the app’s gallery, and the user’s device’s gallery, if allowed. The community feature allows users to connect with 
                      other dancers that they know and share entries. This would be especially helpful for a collaborative dance or a dance class,
                       as it would provide every member with the music, choreography, or notes about the performance. There is also a profile page,
                        in which you can add a picture and bio and edit your personal information, as well as a settings page and a page that shows
                         app statistics.</p>
